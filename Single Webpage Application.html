<h3>Syllabus</h3>
<p>The study of Web application development; examine web technologies, alternative web development methodologies and evaluate various code libraries and tools.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate technologies in this unit. This technology includes using Hypertext Markup
Language (HTML) to define the structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks
to provide for a rich user experience in a business context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify stakeholder requirements and select 
and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible web-based applications.</p>

<h3>Unit Learning Outcome</h3>
<p>All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study.
These inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting.
Each unit in your course addresses the Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes.
They form a vital part in the process referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know, understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit.
Each assessment for this unit is carefully designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes.
On successfully completing all of the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.</p>

portfolio is due during the examination period.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Pass requirements</h2>
<p>To pass the unit, you must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Receive an overall grade of 5 or above (a mark 50% or greater of the overall marks possible); and</li>
	<li>Submit all assessments.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Assessment Moderation</h2>
<h3>Fair assessment through moderation</h3>
<p>Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning 
outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation 
of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from
policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/</p>

<h3>Pre-marking moderation</h3>
<p>A co-assessor is assigned to this unit to review all assessment tasks and marking criteria/rubrics and monitor and 
confirm the integrity of results. Assessment tasks are provided to students before the assessment task, marking 
criteria are provided to students, assessors are provided with marking guides/rubrics and sufficient information to 
ensure fair and consistent evaluation of student work.</p>

<h3>Intra-marking / Post-marking moderation</h3>
<p>The following intra-marking / post-marking moderation practices are planned for use in this unit:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Second marking of student work samples near grade boundaries</li>
    <li>Second marking of borderline student work; or a process of review and validation of decisions where 
        students have not met the pass requirements</li>
	<li>Analysis of the variances between markers and locations</li>
	<li>Second marking of a random sample to check for consistent application of marking criteria and standards</li>
</ul>

<h3>Late Assessment</h3>
<p>Where the submission of a late assessment is permitted, late penalties will be consistently applied in this unit.</p>
<p>Where a late assessment <strong>is</strong> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the Assessment 
Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
<ol>
    <li>For assessment items submitted within the first 24 hours after the due date/time, students will be penalised 
        by a deduction of 5% of the total marks allocated for the assessment task;</li>
	<li>For each additional 24 hour period commenced an additional penalty of 10% of the total marks allocated 
        for the assessment item will be deducted; and</li>
	<li>Assessment items submitted more than 168 hours late (7 calendar days) will receive a mark of zero.</li>
</ol>

<p>Where late assessment <strong>is NOT</strong> permitted for an assessment item or the entirety of the unit (refer to the 
Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline) and the student does not have an approved assessment extension:</p>
<ol>
    <li>All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will receive a mark of zero.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Assessment extension</strong></p>
<p>Where an application for an assessment extension is permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit (refer to 
the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</p>
<ol>
    <li>A student who is unable to complete an assessment item by/on the due date/time as a result of exceptional 
        circumstances beyond the student’s control, may apply for an assessment extension on the Assessment 
        Extension Application Form as prescribed by the Academic Registrar. The form is available on the Forms 
        page at https://students.curtin.edu.au/essentials/forms-documents/forms/ and also within the student's 
        OASIS (My Studies tab – Quick Forms) account.</li>
	<li>The student will be expected to submit their application for an Assessment Extension with supporting 
        documentation via the online form.</li>
	<li>Timely submission of this information supports the assessment process. For applications that are declined, 
        delayed submission may have significant ramifications on the possible marks awarded.</li>
	<li>An application may be accepted up to five working days after the due date/time of the assessment item 
        where the student is able to provide a verifiable explanation as to why they were not able to submit the 
        application prior to the assessment due date/time</li>
</ol>

<p>Where an application for an assessment extension <strong>is NOT</strong> permitted for an assessment item(s) within this unit 
(refer to the Assessment Schedule table in this Unit Outline):</p>
<ol>
    <li>All assessment items submitted after the due date/time will be subject to late penalties or receive a mark of 
        zero depending on the unit permitting late assessment submissions.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Deferred assessment</h3>
<p>If your results show that you have been granted a deferred assessment you should immediately check OASIS for details.</p>

<h3>Further assessment</h3>
<p>Further assessments, if granted by the Board of Examiners, will be held between 13/07/2022 and 22/07/2022 .

Channel in OASIS.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the student to be available to complete the requirements of a further assessment. If your 
results show that you have been granted a further assessment you should immediately check OASIS for details.</p>

<h3>Reasonable adjustments for students with disabilities/health circumstances likely to impact on 
studies</h3>
<p>A Curtin Access Plan (CAP) is a document that outlines the type and level of support required by a student with a 
disability or health condition to have equitable access to their studies at Curtin. Carers for people with disability 
may also be eligible for support. This support can include alternative exam or test arrangements, study materials 
in accessible formats, access to Curtin's facilities and services or other support as discussed with an advisor from 
AccessAbility Services.</p>
